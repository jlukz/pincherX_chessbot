# ü§ñ PincherX Chess Bot
An innovative project to bring the virtual chess-playing experience into the physical world! Using the PincherX 100 robotic arm, this project integrates robotics, computer vision, and chess AI to create an automated chess-playing robot. The robot detects the chessboard and pieces, makes its moves physically, and plays at a customizable ELO level.

## üß† Key Features
- Physical Chess Interaction: The PincherX 100 robotic arm manipulates real chess pieces on a physical board.
- AI-Powered Gameplay: Plays chess at adjustable ELO levels using a chess engine like Stockfish.
- Piece Detection: Integrates computer vision for board and piece recognition.
- Customizable Strategies: Adjust AI difficulty to match your skills.
- Interactive Experience: Designed for both learning and entertainment.
## üéØ Project Objectives
- Integrate Chess AI with Robotic Movements: Use a chess engine to compute moves and translate them into commands for the PincherX 100.
- Detect and Monitor Board State: Employ computer vision to track the board and pieces in real-time.
- Achieve Precision in Movement: Ensure the robotic arm executes moves accurately.
- Customizable Gameplay: Allow users to set difficulty levels and choose AI behavior.
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Robotics: PincherX 100 robotic arm.
- Chess Engine: Stockfish or other open-source chess engines.
- Computer Vision: OpenCV or similar library for detecting the board and pieces.
- Programming: Python/C++ for AI and robotic arm control.
- Communication: ROS (Robot Operating System) or equivalent for interfacing with the robotic arm.
## üöÄ Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- Hardware:
  - PincherX 100 robotic arm.
  - Physical chessboard and pieces.
- Software:
  - Python 3.x.
  - Chess engine (e.g., Stockfish).
  - OpenCV for computer vision.
  - ROS (optional) for controlling the robotic arm.

## üåü Future Enhancements
- Integrate a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier gameplay configuration.
- Enable online opponent connectivity (e.g., connect to Chess.com for real-world matches).
- Implement machine learning for personalized gameplay strategies.

- This project bridges the gap between the virtual and physical worlds of chess, combining robotics and AI to create an engaging, hands-on experience.
